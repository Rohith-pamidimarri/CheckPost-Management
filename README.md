# CheckPost-Management
My project is about the management of vehicles in check posts. The 
way from Kurnool(Andhra Pradesh) to Hyderabad(Telangana) passes 
through the sheshachalam forest where about 7 check posts are there 
to stop the smuggling of Red Sandalwood. Travelers face a lot of 
problems waiting in the queue. It even takes more than 8hrs some 
days to clear the traffic at the check posts…..The way that connects 
Kurnool to Hyderabad via forest is a Double road but not a 
highway…Emergency services like ambulances and fire vehicles face 
a lot of problems to cross the queue at check post reach their 
destination which may cost lives of people. Civil servants, Ministers, 
and MLAs traveling this way face a lot of problems with traffic.
So, In these situations, my Project enables the check postmanagement 
to handle the traffic problems faced by people at least in a few check 
posts.
